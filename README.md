## Project Overview
This website was created in honor of my grandmother, Rina Sher, who has been an inspiration to me throughout the years because of her strength and influence on our family. The website highlights her life and achievements, and offers visitors a glimpse into her personal experiences.

The website includes:
- **About Me**: A short biography detailing her life, achievements, and the experiences that shaped who she is today.
- **My Photos**: A photo gallery showcasing memorable moments from Rina Sher’s life, including family gatherings, important events, and other meaningful memories.
- **Favorite Songs**: A curated playlist of Rina Sher’s favorite songs, embedded from YouTube, allowing visitors to listen to the music she enjoys.
- **Interactive “Like” Button**: A feature that allows visitors to show their appreciation for the website.
- **QR Code**: A QR code displayed on the website for easy access via mobile devices.
- **Contact Me**: A contact form that allows visitors to send contact messages.
